## Customizing Posts
Before running the bot, you can edit the posts in the Python files. Each file corresponds to a specific part of the bot's functionality:  

- Edit `main.py` to change the time of posts and the feed generator URI.    
- Edit `data/post_image.json` to modify image post content.  
- Edit `data/post_text.json` to change text post content.  
- Place your own images in the `images` folder.  

Make sure to save the changes after editing these files.

## Current Use

I am currently using this bot for an online social media account related to **90s Replay**, a future business idea that my son and I want to create. The account posts a lot of 90s nostalgia content, celebrating the era with fun and engaging posts. 

If youâ€™re interested, you can follow the account to see the bot in action or simply enjoy some 90s memories: **@90sReplay** on Bluesky.
